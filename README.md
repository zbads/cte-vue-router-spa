## Vue 3 + Vue Router Basic CRUD
<p>You can see a working version of this project in this [video](https://share.getcloudapp.com/wbub7pOr). This has a basic implementation with list, create, update, and delete evident in the video.</p>

<p>The login functionality is not implemented here so the access token for API requests have been hardcoded (the base URL is also set to localhost).</p>

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
